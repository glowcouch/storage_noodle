# Create Trait
#
# The `Create` trait is used to create a new item in the backing storage. The `Create::create` async function has these return values:
# 
# * In the case of a failure, the future MUST return `Err()`.
# * In the case of a success, the future MUST return `Ok(AssocId<Self, RawId>)` - where the `AssocId` holds the Id of the newly created item.
