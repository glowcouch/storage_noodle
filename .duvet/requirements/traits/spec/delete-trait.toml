# Delete Trait
#
# The Delete trait is used to delete an item from the backing storage. The `Delete::delete` async function has these return values:
# 
# * In the case of a failure, the future MUST return `Err()`.
# * In the case of a partial success, where the operation succeeded, but the item doesn't exist, the future MUST return `Ok(None)`.
# * In the case of a full success, the future MUST return `Ok(Some(()))`.
